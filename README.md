# Clipso - AI-Powered Video Enhancement Platform

## Inspiration

The growing demand for accessible video content creation tools inspired Clipso. With the rise of short-form video content on social platforms, creators need efficient ways to enhance their videos with professional-quality captions and engaging B-roll footage. We recognized that many content creators lack the time or technical expertise to manually add captions and source relevant background imagery, creating a barrier to producing polished, accessible content.

## What it does

Clipso is an AI-powered video enhancement platform that automatically transforms raw video recordings into polished, professional content. The platform:

- **Automatic Transcription**: Converts speech in videos to accurate, timestamped captions using AWS Transcribe
- **Smart Caption Generation**: Creates stylish, readable captions with professional formatting, shadows, and positioning
- **AI-Generated B-Roll**: Automatically generates contextually relevant background images using AWS Bedrock's Titan Image Generator
- **Seamless Video Processing**: Combines original video, captions, and B-roll into a final enhanced video
- **Cloud Storage Integration**: Leverages Cloudflare R2 for scalable, global content delivery
- **Share-Ready Output**: Produces videos optimized for social media platforms with shareable links

## How we built it

### Architecture Overview

Clipso is built with a modern, cloud-native architecture leveraging AWS AI services:

```
Frontend (React/Next.js) → Backend API (FastAPI) → AWS AI Services
                                ↓
                         Cloudflare R2 Storage
                                ↓
                         PostgreSQL Database
```

### Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 18 with Next.js for the user interface
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- Vite for fast development builds
- TypeScript for type safety

**Backend:**
- FastAPI (Python) for high-performance API endpoints
- SQLAlchemy with async PostgreSQL for data persistence
- Alembic for database migrations
- MoviePy for video processing and editing

**AWS AI Services:**
- **Amazon Transcribe**: Converts audio to text with word-level timestamps
- **Amazon Bedrock (Titan Image Generator)**: Creates contextual B-roll images from text prompts
- **S3**: Temporary storage for transcription processing

**Storage & Infrastructure:**
- **Cloudflare R2**: Primary storage for videos and generated content
- **PostgreSQL (Neon)**: Metadata storage and video tracking
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for production deployment

### Key Components

1. **Video Upload Service**: Handles multipart file uploads with progress tracking
2. **AI Transcription Pipeline**: Extracts audio, uploads to S3, processes via AWS Transcribe
3. **Caption Generator**: Renders professional-quality captions with custom styling
4. **B-Roll AI Engine**: Analyzes transcript content and generates relevant imagery
5. **Video Compositor**: Combines all elements into final enhanced video

### Processing Flow

1. User uploads video file
2. Video stored in Cloudflare R2 with unique identifier
3. Audio extracted and sent to AWS Transcribe for speech-to-text
4. Transcript analyzed to identify key topics for B-roll generation
5. AWS Bedrock generates contextual background images
6. Caption styling engine creates professional text overlays
7. MoviePy composites final video with captions and B-roll
8. Enhanced video stored and shareable link generated

## Challenges we ran into

**AWS Service Integration**: Initially struggled with proper IAM permissions for AWS Transcribe and Bedrock services. Required careful configuration of user policies for `transcribe:StartTranscriptionJob`, `bedrock:InvokeModel`, and S3 access permissions.

**Video Processing Performance**: Handling large video files efficiently while maintaining quality. Implemented streaming uploads and background processing to prevent timeouts and improve user experience.

**Caption Synchronization**: Achieving precise timing between spoken words and visual captions required fine-tuning timestamp handling from AWS Transcribe's word-level output.

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**: Resolved CORS issues when serving videos from R2 storage by implementing a streaming proxy endpoint in our API.

**Database Schema Evolution**: Managing database migrations for video metadata, transcripts, and sharing features while maintaining data integrity across deployments.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

**Seamless AWS Integration**: Successfully integrated multiple AWS AI services into a cohesive workflow, demonstrating the power of cloud-native AI solutions.

**Real-Time Processing**: Built a responsive system that provides live feedback during video processing, keeping users engaged throughout the enhancement workflow.

**Professional Caption Quality**: Developed a sophisticated caption rendering system that rivals commercial video editing software, with customizable fonts, shadows, and positioning.

**Scalable Architecture**: Designed a system capable of handling concurrent video processing jobs with efficient resource utilization.

**User-Friendly Interface**: Created an intuitive web interface that makes professional video enhancement accessible to non-technical users.

## What we learned

**AWS AI Service Capabilities**: Gained deep understanding of Amazon Transcribe's accuracy and timing precision, and Amazon Bedrock's image generation capabilities for content creation.

**Video Processing Optimization**: Learned techniques for efficient video manipulation, including format conversion, stream handling, and memory management for large files.

**Cloud Storage Strategy**: Discovered the benefits of using Cloudflare R2 for global content delivery and cost-effective storage compared to traditional CDN solutions.

**Asynchronous Processing Patterns**: Implemented robust background task handling for long-running video processing operations without blocking the user interface.

**AI Prompt Engineering**: Developed effective prompting strategies for generating contextually relevant B-roll images that enhance rather than distract from video content.
